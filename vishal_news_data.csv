48,"Kolkata: TMC's popular poll jingle 'Khela Hobe' (game is on) seems to have also caught the fancy of rival BJP, as political heavyweights of both the parties draw references to its lyrics, sometimes even building slogans around the song, at their public meetings in Bengal. Originally written and uploaded on YouTube by TMC leader Debangshu Bhattacharya in January, the jingle has since undergone many variations, with the party's Birbhum strongman Anubrata Mondal first giving it a spin and chanting 'bhoyonkor khela hobe' (fierce game will be played) at a rally.""The song 'Khela Hobe' has been able to establish an instant connect with people. It has received a favourable response from youth across the state,"" Bhattacharya said. At a recent rally in Kamarhati constituency addressed by Bhattacharya, a thousand-strong crowd lapped up every word of the song delivered in a rap format.Former minister and the ruling camp's candidate from the constituency, Madan Mitra, has recorded his own version of 'Khela Hobe', while the party's Ghatal MLA Shankar Dolai was recently seen dancing wildly to the beats of the song at a roadshow. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also been asking voters at rallies if they were ready for the game to begin (Khela Hobe?), drawing loud cheers from the crowd.""Khela Hobe. Ami goalkeeper. Dekhi ke jete,"" (the game is on. I will do the goal keeping. Let's wait and see who wins,"" Banerjee said at a meeting. The BJP, which had initially criticised the TMC for likening the political battle with a game and ""trivialising"" the democratic process, co-adopted the slogan later, with defence minister Rajnath Singh, among other saffron camp leaders, bringing 'khela hobe' references in their speech, in a bid to take a jibe at Banerjee and her party.

Twelve fire trucks were dispatched to extinguish the huge blaze as smoke billowed over the area, with the cause not immediately clear. The state prosecutor has tasked a team with investigating the fire, the sources added.Egypt has had a string of fires in recent years, as shoddy buildings have been constructed without safety standards amid a security vacuum following its 2011 revolution."
51,"In keeping with the political grain of the ruling order in Uttar Pradesh, like its predecessors, the Yogi Adityanath dispensation resisted calling the elections to the state’s rural bodies. UP’s political parties, which treat every election like a carnival, were curiously reluctant to hold gram panchayat elections which are invariably scheduled close to an Assembly poll and, therefore, regarded as a measure of their strengths and weaknesses. These elections, barring those to elect zilla panchayat representatives, are not fought on party symbols. Expectedly, the major players hotly contest the results, because like it or not, the outcome loosely defines political allegiances in the villages. In February this year, the Allahabad High Court directed the state election commission to conduct the rural polls by April because the tenure of the panchayats, numbering nearly 60,000, ended in December. The three-tiered process will elect representatives to the vikas khands or development blocks and the gram sabhas or village assemblies, the kshetra or area panchayats, and the zilla or district panchayats. The court had similarly intervened in 2005, when Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister of the day, tried to put off the exercise, two years before the Assembly elections."

It is up to the medical facilities, depending upon the availability of staff, to decide on the number of hours to carry out the vaccination,” state health departments principal secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said. Currently, medical staff, frontline workers as designated by the government, people above 60 years of age and those between aged between 45 and 59 with co-morbidities are eligible to get the vaccine shots."

Six TMC MPs from both the Houses of Parliament are expected to arrive in Delhi to join the delegation, a source said. A delegation of the party met poll panel officials in Kolkata on Thursday and later alleged that the “Election Commission did nothing despite there being reports of a possible attack on Banerjee”.Claiming that the attack was a “deep-rooted conspiracy to take the life of the TMC supremo”, party leaders said anti-social elements have been mobilised from the neighbouring states by the BJP in Nandigram to unleash violence. The EC can’t shun responsibility as it is in charge of the law-and-order situation in poll-bound West Bengal, it said."
54,"New Delhi: Expressing concern over the rise in active COVID-19 cases in a few states, including Maharashtra, the Centre on Thursday advised people to be ""careful and watchful"" and not lower guard as the pandemic is not yet over. At a press conference, NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul termed the coronavirus situation, especially in Maharashtra ""worrisome"". He referred to the lockdown imposed in Nagpur from March 15 to 21 to say, ""We are reaching a situation where these approaches (to tackle the spread of COVID-19) are being brought back."" ""We are very worried about the rise in cases in Maharashtra. Don't take this virus for granted. It can come up unexpectedly. If we have to remain free of this virus, COVID-appropriate behaviour, containment strategy as well as vaccination has to be brought in,"" Paul said.He advised that in districts where COVID-19 cases are seemingly on the rise, vaccination of eligible individuals should be intensified and prioritised. Sounding a word of caution for Delhi and its neighbourhood, Paul said the national capital is seeing a rise in positivity rate, so is Gurgaon, Faridabad and to an extent Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad.""Be careful, be watchful. We still have a huge population at risk of this virus. This pandemic is not yet over. Be vigilant,"" he said. ""Today, using the force of vaccination, we are in a position to give even a stronger fight (to the pandemic). We plead again, do not lower your guard and please embrace the vaccines that are available,"" Paul added.Asked whether a mutant strain of the coronavirus is responsible for the rise in cases, ICMR Director General Dr Balram Bhargava said it has not been found incriminating in the surge in Maharashtra. ""At the moment, it is just related to reduced testing, tracking and tracing as well as COVID-inappropriate behaviour and large congregations,"" he said.

127,"You may have an opinion on this, and you are free to have one, but I strongly believe that the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is by far and away the best-looking Redmi series phone. As yet, that is. This is most certainly a case of Xiaomi really upping the design game for phones starting around Rs 11,999 (that’s where the Redmi Note 10 pricing starts) and going all the way up to the Rs 21,999 mark, which is how much the top spec variant of this Redmi Note 10 Pro Max costs. In the middle there is also the Redmi Note 10 Pro, which makes it a troika of new phones that will renew Xiaomi’s already very strong grip on the affordable Android smartphone market in India. Why I say that? Numbers tell their own tale—the Q4 2020 numbers, as reported by Counterpoint, tell us what we already knew. Xiaomi has a 26% share of the Indian smartphone market, ahead of Samsung. And if phones as beautiful as these keep trickling in, Xiaomi’s Made in India phones should continue to fly off the shop shelves.It is important to illustrate the width of just the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max range that goes on sale in India at this time. The entry spec option, which is 6GB RAM and 64GB storage is priced at Rs 18,999. A spec up gets you 6GB+128GB for Rs 19,999—and why wouldn’t you really spend that extra grand to get this variant? And if you can spend Rs 21,999 on the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max, you can buy yourself the 8GB+128GB configuration. All three are available in the Dark Night, Glacial Blue and Vintage Bronze colour options. The Redmi Note 10 Pro Max’s competition? There is the very capable Samsung Galaxy M51 with prices starting around Rs 22,999 and the Realme X7 5G which is priced upwards of Rs 19,999 depending on which variant you pick. The question is, do any of the rivals feel this premium?"

298,"New Delhi: Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Wednesday said that prevention of diabetes in pregnancy is crucial to protect the next generation from the disease. He released guidelines for management of the health issue, prepared by the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group of India (DIPSI).Singh is a noted diabetologist and one of the founding members of DIPSI. Delivering the keynote address at a National Gestational Diabetes Awareness Day summit, being virtually hosted from Bengaluru, he said that prevention of diabetes in pregnancy is crucial to protect the next generation from diabetes, according to a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.The minister said it was way back in 1970s that V Seshiah first gave the concept of Spot Test for pregnant women, which in other words meant that any pregnant woman coming to hospital at any stage of pregnancy, fasting or non-fasting, should be subject to a blood sugar test. DIPSI is headed by Seshiah, one of the founding fathers of Diabetology in India. Many of his contemporaries at that time would not understand what it was all about, but it was in fact not only a revolutionary concept in clinical medicine but also a novel concept at the social level considering the heterogeneity and socio-economic constraints prevailing in the Indian society, said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel.He said it has taken almost a quarter century of intense research to institutionalise the concept given by Dr Seshiah and he felt proud to have conducted one of the earliest studies to test the outcome and benefit of tight blood glucose control in pregnant women. Singh said it is a matter of pride that the guidelines for the Management of diabetes prepared under the guidance of Dr Seshiah are now being followed worldwide and even the World Health Organization has recommended the same, the statement said.

The entire concept, Singh said, revolves around the fact that a woman with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is prone to increase the risk of future diabetes in the progeny and, therefore, the aim should be to ensure a tight control of blood glucose level so that her metabolic milieu and intra-uterine environment is as normal physiologically as that of non-diabetic pregnant woman and the baby grows inside the womb without even realising that its mother had ever gone through diabetes, it said. Singh said the diabetes in pregnancy guidelines being released today will not only contribute to serve the cause of diabetes but also a humble contribution to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'new India'.""The new India is comprised of 70 per cent of the population below the age of 40 years and the challenge faced today is increasing prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the young. New India's strength will be determined by its youth and it cannot afford this youth energy to go under-utilized because of diabetes-mellitus, he added. .setTimeout(() => {

The woman approached the court seeking immediate directions to ensure that she is provided with security and protection from her family and to direct her parental and matrimonial family to cease and desist from contacting, threatening or coercing her in any manner.

629,"The Supreme Court Tuesday came out with a solution to end stalemate between NOIDA and private firms over execution of lease deeds for plots on which five-star and three-star hotels were to come up before Commonwealth Games, 2010, by ordering fresh e-auction of government land within three months. The apex court approved a plan under which the plots, which are with the private companies for making hotels, would go back to NOIDA which, in turn, put them for fresh e-auction and out of the proceeds, the money deposited by the companies would be returned to them by NOIDA with interest. NOIDA (New Okhla Industrial Development Authority) shall put up the plots in question for auction or invite E-bids within three months, in the same fashion as was done in connection with the property referred to in the communication dated 21.10.2019. It will be entirely up to NOIDA to put up the plots for sale collectively or individually or to sell them for any purpose which in the opinion of NOIDA would sub-serve public interest and devise the modalities for sale. From and out of the sale proceeds received in such sale, the amounts indicated above shall be paid to each of the Petitioners exercising such Second Option in accordance with the principles as stated above, within three months of the sale, a bench of justices UU Lalit, Indu Malhotra and Krishna Murari said. The top court termed the present status as nothing but a stalemate in which valuable assets of a public authority are locked completely.The public interest is neither getting sub-served, nor is NOIDA getting instalments towards premium on time, the bench said in its 30-page judgement. NOIDA in 2006 had launched the Hotel Plot Allotment Scheme to cater to the need of hotels at the time of the mega-sporting event in the national capital and at the request of the union sports ministry, it had decided to lease out plots for construction of 25 hotels, including 5 five-star hotels, at a reserve rate of Rs 7,400 per square meter.Litigations, including PILs, were filed by various parties in the Allahabad High Court and later in the the apex court on the issues seeking either cancellation or execution of the lease deeds on various grounds. Initially, the Uttar Pradesh government, on being asked by the high court to take a re-look in regard to the allotments in view of the allegation that the reserve price was very low, re-considered the issue and found the allotments to be irregular and directed NOIDA to cancel the same. Later on the plea of private firms, the high court set aside the state's decision of cancellation and asked it to reconsider the issue on the ground that allottees were not heard earlier.

The state government passed individual orders and stuck to its stand of cancellation of lease deeds leading to a fresh round of litigation in the apex court. The apex court, on July 5, 2011, found that the allotment of commercial plots to the allottees was valid and legal, but, held that the commercial plots could have fetched premium at a rate of Rs 70,000 per square metre at the relevant time.The allottees who were willing to pay the premium at Rs.70,000/- per square metre, with corresponding increase in yearly rent/one-time lease rent without any location benefit charges, could exercise an option whereafter an amendment to the lease deed had to be executed between NOIDA and the concerned allottee, the apex court had held. But those allottees, who were unwilling to continue the lease by paying the higher premium, were to be returned all amounts paid by them towards the allotment and the lease, it had said. Seven companies, who did not opt out, filed the contempt plea against NOIDA alleging disobedience of the apex court's decision on execution of lease deed on fulfillment of certain conditions. The top court disposed of the contempt plea and rather came out with the modalities to resolve the impasse. Though the scope of the Contempt Petitions was restricted to see whether functionaries of NOIDA were guilty of disobedience of the directions issued by this Court, the matter was considered from the standpoint of enabling both sides to settle their disputes and get over the stalemate which has been obtaining for the last 10 years. The endeavour was to see that the interest of both sides is sufficiently taken care of and more than anything else, the public interest must stand sub-served. It is with this solution in mind, that the directions as stated above have been issued by this Court, the judgement said.setTimeout(() => {
